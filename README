Hello,

Get up Get Moving Project.
GCSE I.T.

I've attempted to tidy the code. Most of the pages use ?php? to import the
header and the footer file which are in <html> files. There is some javascript
and some jQuery for animations but any processing is done in ?php?

The quiz section is largely custom made and all of the processsing is done
in ?php? and all of the information is stored in text files.

This is a very messy project. It's purpose made and all of the content is 
static which makes it kind of pointless putting it on github but I need
version control.

P.S. There will be a lot of commits on this project. This is not a reflection
of how much work there has been done on the project but rather how much time
I have spent wrestling with Github on my new Macbook.

Ben xx
